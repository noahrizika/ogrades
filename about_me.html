    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I’m a biochemistry major and having decided against the medical or bioscience research path, I aim to pursue my
        other interest in computer science. Due to this late decision, I’ve taken my education into my own hands,
        enrolling in various online programs and teaching myself as much as I can. This past summer, I took Udacity’s
        AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree course, completing the course twice as fast as traditionally expected.
        I used the extra time to develop a computer vision model for a Biology research professor at Dartmouth,
        understand data structures and basic sorting algorithms in C++, understand cloud computing, and refresh myself
        in basic web development and github. I also worked as a data analyst, using NVivo to help the food studies
        department synthesize food system transformation perspectives from different actors in the industry. I’m
        currently working on a 30,000+ article data analysis project to uncover how AI is portrayed by media outlets in
        different countries and of different political leanings. By chasing what truly interests me, I leverage my
        curiosity, assertiveness and determination into successful learning experiences.</p>
    <p>
        Programming requires quick thinking, adaptability, problem solving, teamwork and communication. I’ve had many
        roles throughout my college enrollment, each helping me grow in different ways. As a backcountry backpacking and
        canoeing guide, I’ve learned how to lead and anticipate group dynamics. As an EMT working in Israel, I’ve had to
        think and work quickly as a team to adapt to the current situation, and ensure the best possible outcome for the
        patient. While performing carbon footprint assessment, I’ve learned to work on a team, and most importantly,
        I’ve learned I benefit most when working with passionate and dedicated individuals. This is further proved
        during my time as an assistant neuroscience researcher. Surrounding myself with experts in their field who have
        committed their life to a subject inspires me. Being onboarded on to a current research project also improved my
        ability to quickly learn something new and then add my own background in the sciences to advance the research
        methods and communicate my thoughts with other researchers and present the current findings to a more general
        audience. Having a variety of other experiences, ranging from X to Y, I’ve developed skills in anticipating and
        understanding problems and being able to communicate effectively with a team to solve them; I’ve learned when to
        ask for help and when I should push myself to grow without explicit instruction. I’ve developed a host of skills
        that will greatly benefit a start up such as BETA.
