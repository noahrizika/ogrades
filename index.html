                <p>My name is Noah Rizika, and I'm a senior at Middlebury College in Vermont. I'll be graduating with a
                    degree in biochemistry, and after deciding against medical and biochemical research careers, I'm
                    pursuing my other interest: coding! I'm looking to combine my medical and chemical knowledge into a
                    career in creating embedded medical device software.</p>
                <p>Before pursing a career in programming, I've had a variety of experiences, ranging from leading
                    groups on multi-day backcountry trips to assisting in neuroscience research. Orchestrating
                    my own computer science education, I've taken some of Middlebury's courses, such as Computer
                    Architecture and a data analytics course, and many more online courses from coursera, Udemy and
                    Udacity. Most notably, I've earned Udacity's Nanodegree in Machine Learning with AWS.</p>
