                    Classifier</strong></a>
            </br>
            The submission of this project completed my Udacity Nanodegree: AWS Machine Learning Engineer. The
            assignment
            motivated me to make the most of my education. I combined my biochemistry and premed background into a
            coding
            project, reaching out to a professor in the biology department at Dartmouth to learn how I could apply my
            new
            skills to benefit his research.
            </br>
            </br>
            <b>The Project's Background</b></br>
            This project is inspired by an issue that arises in cell biology, specifically, research on Drosophila
            embryos.
            The research project that this model aims to assist studies how genes work together to regulate cell
            behavior,
            thereby generating different tissue forms. Drosophila embryos are a great model for this research because of
            their genetic components, live-imaging accessibility and biophysical analysis. The relative ease of cell
            imaging
            allows researchers to photograph and classify a cell’s stage at different intervals.
            </br>
            </br>
            <b>Problem Statement</b></br>
            In this research project, many images of individual cells were captured, manually classified, and further
            analyzed as per the research focus explained in the previous paragraph. However, classifying the embryonic
            stage
            for Drosophila cells is difficult, tedious and time consuming.
            </br>
            </br>
            <b>Solution</b></br>
            To expedite the research process, I have built an image classification model to classify the stage of
            embryonic
            cell development for Drosophila cell images. The project will be created entirely in AWS Sagemaker, using a
            Jupyter notebook and python training scripts. After manually uploading data to Sagemaker, the data will be
            augmented and uploaded to S3 via the Jupyter notebook.

        <p>As a major in Biochemistry, I've learned many simple yet tedious and time-consuming calculations. Creating
            programs to automate these calculations allowed me to focus on the larger scope of a problem while also
            reducing errors.</p>

        <h4>DNA Stacking Energy Calculator</h4>
        <p>DNA is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between paired nucelotides on corresponding strands. However, the
            interactions between stacked nucelotides on each strand play an even larger role in stabilizing DNA. This
            program calculates the stacking energies of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Lower energies indicate greater
            stability.</p>
